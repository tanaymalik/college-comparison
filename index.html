    <h2>FEES PER YEAR</h2>
 
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="element-1">
            $79,450 a year
        </div>  

        <div id="element-2">
            $83,880 a year
      
        </div>

    </div>
<p>Harvard and Yale are expensive universities to attend. 
    As such esteemed schools with extensive resources and facilities to support students
    , their tuition costs are some of the most expensive in the nation. </p>

   <p> Both schools have almost identical costs of attendance. While Yale’s cost
     of attendance of a first-year student is $83,880 a year, and Harvard’s is
      $79,450, these estimates only include the cost of tuition, room, and board. 
    They do not consider the costs of transportation, textbooks and equipment, 
    and other personal costs, which can spike the total costs to around $90,000
    -$100,000. Past your first year, Yale may be the cheaper option for you, 
    depending on where you choose to live. </p>
    
    <p>The average cost of off-campus housing at Harvard is $1,787 a month, which 
    is expected of such a large city. On the other hand, Yale’s off-campus housing 
    for one person is estimated to be around $1,100 a month. </p>



    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
 
    <div id="main-div">
        <div id="element-1">
            Cambridge, Massachusetts
        </div>  

        <div id="element-2">
            Northeastern region
      
        </div>    
    </div>

    <p>Both Harvard and Yale are located in the Northeastern region. 
        However, Harvard is situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts which is a large city just miles away from Boston. Cambridge is known to be a vibrant and bustling city with high energy and lots to do! </p>

      <p>  This close proximity to Boston also gives students access to 
        a dynamic and diverse economy, providing them with unparalleled 
        opportunities in a variety of industries. On the other hand, Yale
         is located in New Haven, Connecticut, a smaller city that is 
         around two hours away from Boston. </p>
        
     <p>  New Haven is considered to be a historic city best known
         for its museums, architecture, and food. Students interested 
         in living in a smaller, tight-knit community while still having
         access to large city opportunities can get the best of both worlds
          at Yale!</p>
